#EXCEPTION HANDLING

This was from a project in Spring 2015 Data Structures (Java 2).

Our first project where we had to read from a large text file with over 40,000 lines which had missing information in a couple lines. 

Ex. a line would have its zip code missing.

I utilized the comparable interface in order to compare lines and sort them accordingly for each question.
The specifications document will be in the docs folder.

Errors that were never fixed : Displaying all cities with same lat/lon and different zip codes, commenting, and listing all different postal code types.
